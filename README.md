# Robot-Leg-Control
This project is final project of my school. Stm32 NUCLEO-F746ZG development board is used as main board. 
After bunch of know-how the file SimulinkKontrolluRobotBacak is changed with USBDENEMETEZ. Final stage of the project is USBDENEMETEZ.
If you want to fork and use this project, you must first Run USBDENEMETEZ and then open MATLAB Simulink.
For detailed information you can look at the pdf below.
